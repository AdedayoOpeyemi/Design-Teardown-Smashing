# Smashing Magazine Design Teardown

> We built a heatmap of the Smashing Magazine website, showing how the areas stood out relative to each other using a grayscale palette.

This project was all about figuring out what makes Smashing Magazine tick. We were using CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity) principles. We were looking for different applications of these principles and reproducing them in our study of the site. I guess that's why it's called a 'teardown'. Feel free to check it out and tell us what you think!
